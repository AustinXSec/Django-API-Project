About This Project

This is our first project using the Python Django framework. My friend Lizandro and I decided to dive into backend development, and Django was the perfect choice. Django is a high-level Python framework that helps you build web applications quickly and cleanly. It handles routing, database management, and security, letting us focus on building features.

At its core, Django follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern:

Models define the structure of your data and handle database operations.

Views define what your application does when it receives a request.

URLs map requests to views so users can interact with your app.

Learning Experience

Create API endpoints for CRUD operations.

Use Django’s ORM to interact with the database.

Serialize data to send it as JSON responses.

This project is not just a technical exercise—it’s also a record of our journey learning Django and building something practical from scratch.

Everything you see will look unprofessional and confusing, this is our first time Lol
